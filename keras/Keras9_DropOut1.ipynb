    "## Dropout\n",
    "Dropout is a regularization technique for neural network models. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. They are dropped-out randomly. This means that their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a neural network learns, neuron weights settle into their context within the network. Weights of neurons are tuned for specific features providing some specialization. Neighboring neurons come to rely on this specialization, which if taken too far can result in a fragile model too specialized to the training data. This reliance on context for a neuron during training is referred to as complex co-adaptations. You can imagine that if neurons are randomly dropped out of the network during training, that other neurons will have to step in and handle the representation required to make predictions for the missing neurons. This is believed to result in multiple independent internal representations being learned by the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect is that the network becomes less sensitive to the specific weights of neurons. This in turn results in a network that is capable of better generalization and is less likely to overfit the training data."

    "### Dropout Regularization in Keras\n",
    "Dropout is easily implemented by randomly selecting nodes to be dropped-out with a given probability (e.g. 20%) each weight update cycle. Dropout is only used during the training of a model and is not used when evaluating the skill of the model. Next we will explore a few different ways of using Dropout in Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here use the Sonar dataset binary classification dataset. Evaluate the models using scikit-learn with 10-fold cross-validation.  There are 60 input values and a single output value and the input values are standardized before being used in the network. The baseline neural network model has two hidden layers, the first with 60 units and the second with 30. Stochastic gradient descent is used to train the model with a relatively low learning rate and momentum."

    "Practical tips from the reference paper:\n",
    " - Generally use a small dropout value of 20%-50% of neurons with 20% providing a good\n",
    "    starting point. A probability too low has minimal effect and a value too high results in\n",
    "    under-learning by the network.\n",
    " - Use a larger network. You are likely to get better performance when dropout is used\n",
    "    on a larger network, giving the model more of an opportunity to learn independent\n",
    "    representations.\n",
    " - Use dropout on input (visible) as well as hidden layers. Application of dropout at each\n",
    "    layer of the network has shown good results.\n",
    " - Use a large learning rate with decay and a large momentum. Increase your learning rate\n",
    "    by a factor of 10 to 100 and use a high momentum value of 0.9 or 0.99.\n",
    " - Constrain the size of network weights. A large learning rate can result in very large\n",
    "    network weights. Imposing a constraint on the size of network weights such as max-norm\n",
    "    regularization with a size of 4 or 5 has been shown to improve results."
